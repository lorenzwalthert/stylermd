  collapse = TRUE,

)
```

We use the following notation for data structures in this package in the 
following hierarchy: 

* text: A text to style.
* paragraph: A subset of the text. Each paragraph contains a body and a class. 
  The header of Markdown for example can be a paragraph, but also paragraph in 
  the grammatical sense or an enumeration.
* listing: One element from a paragraph. Only applicable to enumerations and 
  bullet lists. This is necessary because each bullet point / enumeration needs
  to be processed separately.
